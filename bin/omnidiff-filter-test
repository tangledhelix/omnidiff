Usage: $0 <file> <filter>

file   - File used as input
filter - A regex filter to test against <file>

It is best to surround the filter with single quotes to avoid variable
interpolation by the shell. Here is an example that strips the password field
from /etc/shadow on common Unixes:

$0 /etc/shadow 's/^([^:]+):[^:]+:/\$1:******:/gm'

Any Perl regular expression should work. See perlre(1) and perlreref(1) for
more information.
